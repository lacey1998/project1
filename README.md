# ðŸ“¦ Package Tracking System

A system for tracking packages and delivery notifications across multiple carriers.

## Project Overview
This **Package Tracking System** is designed to extract package details from emails automatically, sort them by delivery date, and notify users of upcoming deliveries. The system **prioritizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and is implemented using **JavaScript**. 

âš¡ **Key Features:**
- Extracts package information (tracking number, shipping company, sender, delivery date) from emails.
- Organizes packages by **delivery date** and allows users to filter by status (**Delivered, In Transit, Arriving Soon**).
- Simulates **notifications** for upcoming deliveries.
- Enables users to **categorize** packages (Electronics, Clothing, Gift).
- Supports **search and filtering** by tracking number, sender, or category.

## Project Structure
- `/docs/`: This directory contains **JSDoc-generated documentation** for the project. After running `npm run doc`, JSDoc will generate an HTML documentation site here. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to view the API documentation.
- `CS5700 Project 1 Design a Social Network.pdf`: The project specification document outlining the requirements and objectives.
- `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`: A markdown file demonstrate the application of object oriented programming in my code, such as OOP pillars, SOLID Principles, and design patterns.
- `/src/`
- `cli.js`: The command-line interface script that allows users to interact with the package tracking system via terminal commands.
- `package-tracker.js`: The core module responsible for parsing emails, extracting package information, and managing package statuses.
