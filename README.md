# ðŸ“¦ Package Tracking System

## Project Overview
This **Package Tracking System** is designed to extract package details from emails automatically, sort them by delivery date, and notify users of upcoming deliveries. The system **prioritizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and is implemented using **JavaScript**. 

âš¡ **Key Features:**
- Extracts package information (tracking number, shipping company, sender, delivery date) from emails.
- Organizes packages by **delivery date** and allows users to filter by status (**Delivered, In Transit, Arriving Soon**).
- Simulates **notifications** for upcoming deliveries.
- Enables users to **categorize** packages (Electronics, Clothing, Gift).
- Supports **search and filtering** by tracking number, sender, or category.
